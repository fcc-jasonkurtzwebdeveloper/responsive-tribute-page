        <h2>Literary Works</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>Oswald Chambers has inspired many people through his teaching and preaching. Chambers has touched many lives, mostly through the words in his book entitled “My Utmost for His Highest”. As a daily devotional that contains 366 commentaries, including an extra day for leap years. Each day contains a title, a biblical verse or passage, and Chambers commentary about the featured verse or passage. Chambers expresses some very insightful and motivating ideals within these texts. While Chambers
        is credited for the words within this devotional, it was not him who penned them.</p>

        <p>While preparing the text for this page, I began to research more about Oswald Chambers. As I searched for information on Chambers, I quickly began to realize that I had a very limited view of who Chambers was. I knew that he was the author of a book that is well known in Christian circles. I did not know that his wife, Gertrude “Biddy” Hobbs was the person responsible for the publication under Chamber’s entitled “My Utmost for His Highest”. Furthermore, there are more than 40 literary
        works attributed to Chambers name but penned by Hobbs.</p>

        <p>Gertrude Hobbs, Chambers’ wife, was exceptionally good at taking shorthand notes. Hobbs was an accomplished stenographer who was able to transcribe information into shorthand at 250 words per minute. This ability allowed her to clearly transcribe
        her husband’s lectures, speeches, and sermons, into the books that we now know as the literary works of Oswald Chambers. The entire collection of literary works has been published as “The Complete Works of Oswald Chambers”. While Hobbs is responsible
        for transcribing and publishing these works, they are still the words of the late Mr. Oswald Chambers.</p>

        <h2>Life and Death</h2>
        <hr>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <hr class="sub-header">

        <p>Oswald Chambers was born in Aberdeen, Scotland on July 24, 1874. His father Clarence Chambers served in many rolls within the Baptist Church, including as a Pastor. Oswald Chambers was baptized at the age of 16 and became a member of the Rye Lane
        Baptist Chapel. As a teenager Chambers was well known for his spirituality and his work with the poor. He was also gifted in music and art.</p>

        <p>Chambers studied art at the College of Edinburgh. While still at the College, Chambers felt a call into ministry. He began studying at a theological training school called Dunoon College. He began to teach classes. When the founder of the institution was injured, Chambers took on much of the administrative work.</p>

        <h3>Early Missionary Work</h3>
        <hr class="sub-header">

        <p>Chambers was introduced to a man by the name of Juji Nakada, an evangelist from Japan. Nakada excited Chamber’s interest in world evangelism. In 1906, Chambers and Nakada set out for Japan via the United States. In 1907, Chambers spent a semester
        teaching at God’s Bible School in Cincinnati. Chambers than spent a few months in Japan. Chambers then arrived home, only to leave again in 1908 for the United States. On the trip back to the United States, Chambers traveled with Gertrude
        Hobbs, who later became his wife. They married in 1910. In 1913, Gertrude gave birth to their first and only child, Kathleen Chambers.</p>

        <h3>Bible Training College</h3>
        <hr class="sub-header">

        <p>In 1911, Oswald Chambers founded a bible training college in Clapham Common, Greater London. By 1915, 106 resident students had attended Chambers’ college, with 40 of them serving as missionaries post college.</p>

        <h3>The War</h3>
        <hr class="sub-header">

        <p>In 1915, during World War I, Chambers suspended the operations of his college to serve the YMCA as a chaplain. He was assigned to the Zeitoun, Cairo, Egypt. During his stay there he was able to minister to troops from Australia and New Zealand,
        some of which participated in the Battle of Gallipoli.</p>

        <p>When Chambers told the staff at the YMCA that he was going to forgo concerts and movies to replace them with Bible classes, they thought that the men would leave the facilities. To their surprise, Chambers attracted droves of men hungry
        to hear the gospel. When someone would say “I hate religious people” Chambers would return with “I do too.” Chambers had a way of breaking through barriers, such as hating “religious” people, to reach people’s hearts.</p>

        <h3>Death</h3>
        <hr class="sub-header">

        <p>On October 17, 1917 Chambers became ill with an appendicitis. He initially refused treatment as he foresaw a need for open hospital beds considering the anticipated Third Battle of Gaze. On October 29th a surgeon performed an emergence appendectomy,
        only to have Chambers die of a pulmonary hemorrhage nearly a month later, on November 15th, 1917. Chambers was buried in Cairo, Egypt with full Military Honors.</p>
